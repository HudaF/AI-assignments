A star search problem: Developed search agent that takes a Search Problem and return its solution using A* algorithm. The Search Problems are: 1) 8-Puzzle Problem 2) Jumping Frogs puzzle (seven rocks and six frogs)

Optimization: Simulated Annealing
Implemented Simulated Annealing algorithm to find global maximum/minimum of any function. Provides visibility of execution of Simulated Annealing algorithm by plotting graphs of x,y and f using matplotlib.
