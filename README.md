CS 351: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence assignments

A star search problem: Developed search agent that takes a Search Problem and return its solution using A* algorithm. The Search Problems are: 1) 8-Puzzle Problem 2) Jumping Frogs puzzle (seven rocks and six frogs)

Optimization: Implemented Simulated Annealing algorithm to find global maximum/minimum of any function. Provides visibility of execution of Simulated Annealing algorithm by plotting graphs of x,y and f using matplotlib.

Classifiers: Implemented na√ØveBayes classifier from scratch to predict categories for future queries. \
Used scikit-learn based classifiers (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decison Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest Trees) to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset.
